    <h1> Working with Arrays </h1>
    <p>
      An array is one of three parameter in bash, the others are strings/integers and though strings
      are the most common, I am currently learing about the uses of an array. They can function to create 
      a type of string such as adding names to the terminal. I show an example of one of the arrays I learned 
      in my practise script. Over all an array is just a number of listed strings that can map integers.
      <a href='code/module6.py' target='_blank' >Here</a> is my practice script.

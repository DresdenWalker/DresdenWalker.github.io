    <h1>Looking at Bash Commands</h1>
    <p>
      I've been practising with bash very basic bash commands and getting used to finding information throught the manuel
which can be found by typing in the command "man man". There is also another command that I am trying to get familiar with
it's called apropos. It is a finder for files that contains commands for things like keywords and shows the output of the
command. I'm seeing some things I am familiar with, commands such as touch, rm and ls are apearing again as well which is cool 
becasue I have a basic understanding of these commands.

    <h1>Looking at Globs</h1>
    <p>
      A Glob is something that help to find files very effectivly. Using them is very convenient for finding files quickly and 
      efficiently. It works as patterns, taking the few letters and serches for them in your files. This can be used by typing in
      "echo (The letter(s) that you want to serch) *" and it will very quickly serch it up. There are different types, the one I 
      just showed was an example of a string being matched, there is the ? Glob that matches up with single character and [whatever you're serching]
      matches to one of the characters typed inside the bars.

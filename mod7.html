		MagicaVoxel is a 3D building program that you can create almost anything with. I used it to create my character 
	 	that very creativly called THICC BOY and he is shown leaping around. I build him in MagicaVoxel and then uploaded him
	 	to Mixamo which allowed me to animate him. From Mixamo I moved him to PlayCanvas which allowed me to show you THICC BOY 
		in full animation.

      I've been working with special characters recently, looking at the different functions and gaining
      a basic understanding. An example is the # command, which functions as a comment. It has no effect on the actual code
      and is used to write something to the creator as a reminder. There is also double and single quotations, with
      double quotes it will activate whatever code is inside the quotations, with singles it will write 
      everything how it is without any command functioning as one.

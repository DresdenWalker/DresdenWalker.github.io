    <h1>Scheme Computer Language</h1>
    <p>
      The scheme lauguage is a relitivly simple program that you ca use to 
      work with stuff like math problems. Defining is what I have been working with 
      recently and it's a fairly easy process once you get an understanding
      for it. I show how to define absolute values in the script as well as show
      you how it works in the terminal in the video. I can also define squares and
      cubes in the program by typing out (define (square x) (* x x)) which will mutiply
      the x value by two and square it. You can then type in (square 2) and the terminal
      will output 4.

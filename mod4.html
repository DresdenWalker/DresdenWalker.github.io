    <h1>Tests</h1>
    <p>
      I was working with tests mostly, I've looked at the exit codes but my main focuse was 
      on ping packets. I saw that if you use the command "ping -c 1 google.com" as
      demonstrated in the video below, it will show you the speed it can send a packet to google. 
      You can also type in the command "echo $?" it will show the exit code.
